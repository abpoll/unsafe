  title    = "Climate Services: The Business of Physical Risk",
  author   = "Condon, Madison",
  abstract = "A growing number of investors, insurers, financial services
              providers, and nonprofits rely on information about localized
              physical climate risks, like floods, hurricanes, and wildfires.
              The outcomes of these risk projections have significant
              consequences in the economy, including allocating investment
              capital, impacting housing prices and demographic shifts, and
              prioritizing adaptation infrastructure projects. The climate risk
              information available to individual citizens and municipalities,
              however, is limited and expensive to access. Further, many
              providers of climate services use black box models that make
              overseeing the scientific rigor of their methodologies
              impossible--- a concern given scientific critiques that many may
              be obfuscating the uncertainty in their projections.
              Municipalities that want to challenge insurance and bond rating
              determinations must rally significant resources for modeling and
              data, a scattershot policing method at best. And when companies
              have access to sophisticated modeling about future impacts---
              some of them potentially devastating for entire communities---the
              decision to share that information has been largely left up to
              the corporation.This Article argues that actionable and
              transparent information about our climate-changed future is a
              public good that the private sector cannot be depended upon to
              provide equitably or reliably. Further, all private climate
              services rely on upstream climate data and models that were
              collected and produced by an enormous network of public
              institutions. There are important lessons to be learned from the
              recent success of special interests in pressing for the
              privatization of weather data and services---a trend that has
              knock-on effects for weather forecasts globally. This Article
              urges state and federal governments to invest in their own
              climate services capacity at a scale not currently contemplated.
              Risk assessments lacking a scientific basis can lead to
              maladaptation across the economy. While it is a potentially
              limited matter of consumer protection or tort liability when a
              consultancy over-promises its analytical capabilities, it is a
              much larger problem if regulators themselves misunderstand the

              large geographic scale significantly limits efforts to mitigate
              flood risk, such as decision on elevating a property. The

  abstract  = "AbstractCost‐benefit analyses (CBA) of flood management plans
               usually require estimating expected annual flood damages on a
               study area and rely on a complex modelling chain, including
               hydrological, hydraulic and economic modelling, as well as
               geographic information system‐based spatial analysis. As most
               model‐based assessments, these CBA are fraught with uncertainty.
               In this paper, we consider as a case study the CBA of a set of
               flood control structural measures on the Orb Delta, France. We
               demonstrate the use of variance‐based global sensitivity
               analysis to (i) propagate uncertainty sources through the
               modelling chain and assess their overall impact on the outcomes
               of the CBA, and (ii) rank uncertainty sources according to their

               range of possible values at a given level of confidence ? is a
               critical piece of the AVM output, especially in collateral and

               remains highly unstandardised in both terminology and methods.
               In this paper, we present and compare two of the most common

               process information. We compile case studies indicating that
               refined methods and data have a considerable effect on the
               overall assessment of flood risk. But are these improvements
               worth the effort? The adequate level of detail is typically
               unknown and prioritization of improvements in a specific
               component is hampered by the lack of an overarching view on
               flood risk. Consequently, creating the dilemma of potentially
               being too greedy or too wasteful with the resources available

               spot.? For quantitative decision support, more overarching case
               studies in various contexts are needed to reveal the sensitivity
               of the overall flood risk to individual components. This could

               has been spent and progress has been made on damage data

               limitations in available data and knowledge on damage

               assumptions, e.g. the selection of spatial and temporal
               boundaries, and there are many pitfalls in economic evaluation,
               e.g. the choice between replacement costs or depreciated values.
               Much larger efforts are required for empirical and synthetic
               data collection and for providing consistent, reliable data to
               scientists and practitioners. A major shortcoming of damage
               modelling is that model validation is scarcely performed.
               Uncertainty analyses and thorough scrutiny of model inputs and
               assumptions should be mandatory for each damage model
               development and application, respectively. In our view, flood
               risk assessments are often not well balanced. Much more
               attention is given to the hazard assessment part, whereas damage
               assessment is treated as some kind of appendix within the risk
               analysis. Advances in flood damage assessment could trigger
               subsequent methodological improvements in other natural hazard
               areas with comparable time-space properties.",

               insurance. Traditionally undertaken at catchment and national
               scales, recently, efforts have intensified to estimate flood
               risk globally to better allow consistent and equitable decision
               making. Global flood hazard models are now a practical reality,
               thanks to improvements in numerical algorithms, global datasets,
               computing power, and coupled modelling frameworks. Outputs of
               these models are vital for consistent quantification of global
               flood risk and in projecting the impacts of climate change.
               However, the urgency of these tasks means that outputs are being
               used as soon as they are made available and before such methods
               have been adequately tested. To address this, we compare
               multi-probability flood hazard maps for Africa from six global
               models and show wide variation in their flood hazard, economic
               loss and exposed population estimates, which has serious
               implications for model credibility. While there is around
               30\%--40\% agreement in flood extent, our results show that even
               at continental scales, there are significant differences in
               hazard magnitude and spatial pattern between models, notably in
               deltas, arid/semi-arid zones and wetlands. This study is an
               important step towards a better understanding of modelling

  abstract  = "Abstract Large-scale estimations of flood losses are often based
               on spatially aggregated inputs. This makes risk assessments
               vulnerable to aggregation bias, a well-studied, sometimes
               substantial outcome in analyses that model fine-grained spatial
               phenomena at coarse spatial units. To evaluate this potential in
               the context of large-scale flood risk assessments, we use data
               from a high-resolution flood hazard model and structure
               inventory for over 1.3 million properties in Massachusetts and
               examine how prominent data aggregation approaches affect the
               magnitude and spatial distribution of flood loss estimates. All
               considered aggregation approaches rely on aggregate structure
               inventories but differ in whether flood hazard is also
               aggregated. We find that aggregating only structure inventories
               slightly underestimates overall losses (?10\% bias), and when
               flood hazard data is spatially aggregated to even relatively
               small spatial units (census block), statewide aggregation bias
               can reach +366\%. All aggregation-based procedures fail to
               capture the spatial covariation of inputs distributions in the
               upper tails that disproportionately generate total expected
               losses. Our findings are robust to several key assumptions, add

               we show a 26.4\% (24.1--29.1\%) increase in US flood risk by
               2050 due to climate change alone under RCP4.5. Our national
               depiction of comprehensive and high-resolution flood risk
               estimates in the United States indicates current average annual
               losses of US$32.1 billion (US$30.5--33.8 billion) in 2020's
               climate, which are borne disproportionately by poorer
               communities with a proportionally larger White population. The
               future increase in risk will disproportionately impact Black
               communities, while remaining concentrated on the Atlantic and
               Gulf coasts. Furthermore, projected population change (SSP2)
               could cause flood risk increases that outweigh the impact of
               climate change fourfold. These results make clear the need for
               adaptation to flood and emergent climate risks in the United
               States, with mitigation required to prevent the acceleration of
               these risks. Climate change is increasing flood risk, yet models
               based on historical data alone cannot capture the impact.
               Granular mapping of national flood risk shows that losses caused
               by flooding in the United States will increase substantially by

  abstract  = "HAZUS development began in the early 1990s and continues to this
               day as the second maintenance release of HAZUS-MH nears
               completion. This paper discusses the history of HAZUS
               development and plans for the future. HAZUS was created with a
               process that included state-of-the-art review of earthquake loss
               estimation methods, followed by methodology and software
               development, and pilot testing. The model was first released for
               earthquakes in 1997, and consisted of an inventory database,
               ground motion model, building and lifeline damage models, fire
               following model, direct and indirect economic loss models, and
               casualties model. Subsequent enhancements included a new bridge
               damage model and a single/group building analysis model.
               Development of the full earthquake, flood and hurricane-capable
               HAZUS began in 1997, with release as HAZUS-MH in early 2004. The
               Flood Model included methods for assessing riverine and coastal
               flooding damage to buildings, transportation and utility
               lifelines, agricultural areas and vehicles, and debris
               generation, and shelter requirements. Effects of flood warning
               were taken into account, as were flow velocity effects. In 2002,
               prior to release of the full Flood Model, a Flood Information
               Tool was released to allow users to begin collecting and sorting
               local flood hazard data, as well as other pertinent data, for
               Level 2 analyses. The Hurricane Model adapted an existing
               peer-reviewed and validated model that describes the entire
               track and wind field of a hurricane or tropical storm as the
               basis for hazard characterization. Methods for assessing
               building damage, building and tree debris and shelter needs are
               also included in the Hurricane Model. Throughout the history of
               HAZUS, inventory data and methodology development always have
               been mirrored by software implementation efforts, such as
               InCAST, which facilitates development and organization of
               databases for creating building portfolios, and Building Data
               Import Tool (BIT), which allows easy import of tax assessors
               data. The release of HAZUS-MH was followed in early 2005 by the
               first maintenance release, HAZUS-MH MR1. Currently, four
               additional releases are anticipated. HAZUS was used in 2001 to
               estimate annualized earthquake losses for the United States.
               Annualized studies for all three hazards are currently being
               conducted with the newer versions of HAZUS.",

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTCoastal cities face increasing flood hazards due to
               climate change. Physical infrastructures, such as levees, are
               commonly used to reduce flood hazards. To effectively manage
               flood risks, it is important to understand the degree to which
               physical infrastructures change both hazard and exposure. For
               example, many studies suggest that levee construction causes an
               overall increase in risk because levees promote exposure growth
               to a greater degree than they reduce flood hazards. Although this
               so‐called “levee effect” is widely studied, there are knowledge
               gaps surrounding how uncertainties related to levee construction
               and flood risk translate into the occurrence and strength of the
               levee effect in coastal communities. Here, we use agent‐based
               modeling to simulate the influence of flood risk information
               pathways on the dynamics around the levee effect, first under
               idealized conditions and then within a real‐world coastal case
               study. We finally conduct a global sensitivity analysis to
               identify which model factors contribute to the strength of the
               levee effect. We find that, under idealized conditions, the
               strength of the levee effect is highly sensitive to economic
               (e.g., population growth) and engineering (e.g., levee failure)
               factors. However, under more complex coastal conditions, factors
               related to household behavior (e.g., risk aversion) are more
               influential on the strength of the levee effect. Overall, our
               findings emphasize the importance of capturing the interactions
               and uncertainties among multiple behavioral, economic, and
               engineering factors when measuring flood risk in coastal
               communities.",
